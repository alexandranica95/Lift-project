# Lift-project
I've developed an elevators simulator with real life scenarios.

Project hosted using Google Firebase: https://lifts-project-6cc4f.web.app/
# Description
I chose to use HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript and Typescript.
Is a simple and intuitive one page application. In the center of the area, there are two elevators, with call buttons positioned between them for each floor. 
Adjacent to each elevator, on the left and right sides, are internal buttons allowing the user to call the elevator to another floor. 
The simulator cand support multiple calls at the same time.
